# MiniMIS
I am a manager of an enterprise. I usually spend much time to deal with kinds of management informations. And I love programming. So I want to develop a mini management information system to improve my working efficiency.
The miniMIS is base on brower/server mode. It will be achieved by using ASP.NET and SQL Server 2005.
The miniMIS will have four main functions. The first is manage the staff. The sencod is manage the vehicles in my department. The third is manage the performance of work plan. The last is manage the kpi of every employee.
It's a big project for me. I need to learn the knowledge of database management, SQL, HTML, CSS, ASP.NET, C#. So I will be very grateful  to you for your help.
